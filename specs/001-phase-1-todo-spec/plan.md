# Implementation Plan: Phase 1 - Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-phase-1-todo-spec` | **Date**: 2026-01-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-phase-1-todo-spec/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a console-based Todo application in Python. The application will support adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete, using in-memory storage, as defined in the feature specification. The implementation will be strictly AI-generated based on this plan and the specification.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: None (standard library only)
**Storage**: In-memory Python list of objects
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Console
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: N/A for this phase
**Constraints**: Console-only interface, no external libraries, no persistent storage.
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, data is ephemeral and lasts only for the duration of the application session.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **AI-Driven Development:** Yes, all code will be generated by an AI assistant based on the spec.
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Yes, this implementation plan strictly follows the spec, and no extra features will be introduced.
- **Architectural Soundness:** Yes, the plan enforces a clear separation of concerns (data model, core logic, and UI).
- **Strict Environment Constraints:** Yes, the plan respects the Python-only, console-only, and in-memory storage constraints.
- **Clean and Predictable Output:** Yes, the plan defines a clean and logical folder structure.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
specs/001-phase-1-todo-spec/
├── plan.md              # This file
├── data-model.md        # Data model definitions
└── tasks.md             # Task breakdown for implementation
```

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
src/
├── models.py         # Contains the Task data model
├── app.py            # Core application logic (task operations)
└── main.py           # Main entry point, console UI loop
tests/
└── test_app.py       # Unit tests for the application logic
```

**Structure Decision**: A simple, single-project structure is chosen to align with the console-based nature of the application and the principle of simplicity. This structure clearly separates the data model, application logic, and user interface.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations of the constitution are anticipated.
