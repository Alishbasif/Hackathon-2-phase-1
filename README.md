# 🧩 Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo  
## Phase I: Console-Based Todo App (Spec-Driven)

### 📌 Overview
Phase I is the foundation of the **Evolution of Todo** project.  
In this phase, we build a **simple console-based Todo application** using **Spec-Driven Development** with **Gemini CLI** and **Spec-Kit Plus**.

The purpose of this phase is to shift the developer mindset from **manual coding** to **AI-driven system design**, where **clear specifications drive correct implementations**.

⚠️ **Constraint:**  
Manual coding is strictly prohibited.  
All implementation must be generated via **Gemini CLI** by refining specifications.

---

## 🎯 Phase I Objectives
- Practice **Spec-Driven Development**
- Learn to control AI output through **well-written specs**
- Build a working **console-based Todo MVP**
- Lay the architectural foundation for AI-native evolution

---

## 🧠 Development Approach (Spec-Driven)
Each feature in Phase I follows this workflow:

1. **Markdown Constitution**  
   Defines global rules, constraints, and architectural boundaries.

2. **Feature Specification (Spec)**  
   Describes behavior, inputs, outputs, and edge cases.

3. **Gemini CLI Code Generation**  
   Gemini CLI generates the implementation strictly from the spec.

4. **Spec Refinement**  
   Specs are iteratively improved until the generated output meets requirements.

## ✅ Features Implemented (Phase I)

### Core Essentials (MVP)

1. **Add Task**  
   Create new todo items with:
   - Unique ID  
   - Task title  
   - Completion status (Pending / Completed)

2. **Delete Task**  
   Remove a task using its unique ID.

3. **Update Task**  
   Modify an existing task’s title or details.

4. **View Task List**  
   Display all tasks in the console with clear completion indicators.

5. **Mark as Complete**  
   Toggle task status between completed and pending.

## 🖥️ Application Type
- **Interface:** Console / Terminal  
- **Storage:** In-memory (No database in Phase I)  
- **Architecture:** AI-generated modular structure

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Gemini CLI**
- **Spec-Kit Plus**
- **Markdown (Constitution & Specs)**
- **Python / Node.js (AI-generated)**

> ⚠️ Programming language selection is determined by Gemini CLI output.

## 🧭 Learning Outcome

By completing Phase I, we gain:

Hands-on experience with Spec-Driven Development

Understanding of how AI interprets specifications

A strong base for evolving Todo into an AI-powered, cloud-native system

## 🔜 Next Phase

### ➡️ Phase II:
Introduce persistent storage, improved architecture, and preparation for AI agent integration.

## 🏁 Hackathon Context
